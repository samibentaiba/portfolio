  "summary": "I'm a software engineer who evolved from a computer science student into a full-stack developer, then into a software architect and team lead. My journey has taken me through every stage of software creation — from learning computer fundamentals, algorithms, and system design, to mastering multiple programming languages and building complete software solutions. As an architect, I learned to design and implement scalable patterns and system plans, and as an operator, I developed workflows and maintenance strategies to ensure long-term software quality. Through this continuous growth, I’ve become a software engineer capable of planning, creating, and improving entire systems — bridging the gap between development, architecture, and operational excellence."
